# Ziggy App

     - An application which uses swiggy's live API to build, while learning all the REACT core concepts with the project based learning method.

# Concepts Used and Learned

    - Component based building
    - Functional components with props, conditional rendering, destructuring, config driven UI, optional chaining
    - Named & Default export,Reconciliation algorithm/React Fiber
    - Shimmer UI, conditional rendering using ternary operators, how to get input from user
    - Hooks
    - React Router, Outlet and Link component in React Router
    - Class based components, lifecycle, rendering order
    - Lazy loading + suspense
    - Tailwind CSS
    - HOC and how to build accordions
    - Redux Toolkit + react-redux

# Hooks

    - useState
    - useEffect
    - useContext
    - useRouteError
    - useParams
    - useSelector
    - useDispatch
    - Custom hooks

# Redux ToolKit

1.  Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
2.  Build our store
3.  Connect our store to our app (react-redux)
4.  Slice (cart slice - here)
5.  Dispatch (action)
6.  Reducer (binds state & action)
7.  Selector (subscribing to store)

# PS:

I wanted to use Tailwind CSS in this project but my VS CODE started to hang a lot after installing it, which is why I have two repos in my profile under the same name Ziggy. But, don't worry I have learnt Tailwind CSS and know how to use it.
